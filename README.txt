Welcome to my Master's project, code named Rubber Duck.
The goal is to develop a chat agent that helps the user
develop a simple solution to searching or sorting a
data structure.

IMPORTANT:
If you wish to run this project locally, clone the git
repository to your machine and open the directory as a
project in Eclipse. In src/agent/AgentModel.java edit
the global variable MODEL_FOLDER to reflect the path
to src/agent/models/ on your machine. If you wish to
train the agent on your own data, be sure to edit the
same variable in TrainingGround.java as well.

The original training data is in that folder as
cat-training-data.txt and ner-training-data.txt.

Start the program by running src/backend/BackendMain.java.
